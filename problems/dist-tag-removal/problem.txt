Now that you've added a dist-tag or two, let's clean things up.

The only dist-tag you CAN'T ever remove is "latest".  That's because
every package installs it's "latest" tag by default, so that tag has
some special semantics.

You CAN point "latest" to a different version, or delete other tags.

Let's delete all the tags that we can, and also point "latest" at
something other than the most recent release.

Run `npm help dist-tag` to learn more about the command.
