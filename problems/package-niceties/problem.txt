So, we've created a package.json file, but it's missing a few things
that people usually expect.  If you type `npm install`, you'll see
something like this:

    npm WARN package.json %ID% No description
    npm WARN package.json %ID% No repository field.
    npm WARN package.json %ID% No README data

Before we can share this work of art with the world, we need to make
it a bit more polished so that people know how to use it.

First, create a README.md file, with a bit of words in it.

Then, add a "repository" field in your package.json file, with a url
where people can access the code.

You can edit your package.json file by hand, or run `npm init` again.

Run `how-to-npm verify` when you're done.
